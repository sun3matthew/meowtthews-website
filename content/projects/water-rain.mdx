## Water Rain - Blurb

Before this game I had created many small games in Java and various other languages. Eventually I decided to just go for it and make a game. This was during the start of COVID and I was looking for a big project to work on. This game was a passion project where I went into the deep end and learned how to not swim. I made so many mistakes while understanding nothing. Though making a multiplayer RTS as my first game may have not been the best idea, I was able to eventually get it to work and release it. It was an awesome experience playing my game with my friends and building a small community of strangers.

I learned the basics of how not to structure and architect code. How I should have designed my code to support sterilization and net code. I also learned the importance of having an art pipeline to automate many tasks while improving art quality. Though it was a failure in many ways, it was f*cking fun and it was what started my journey.
