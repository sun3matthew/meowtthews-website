# Amlogic - Past

## Software Engineer Intern - Blurb

My project assignment was to help support the operating systems team to help document and research the effects of different build configurations and compression methods. To do this I took the responsibility to create an automatic testing system to interface with the TVs to profile lag times and memory pressure, then writing all relevant data to a table and aggregating them to give an overall score. The development and build environment was a linux server, forcing me to become even more familiar with linux commands. This allowed me to learn about how code bases with thousands of repositories are managed and developed while also learning about how to debug build errors without external tools.
