# The Lonely Tree - Archive

## What is this?

The Lonely Tree is a mini art project game where I had attempted to create a beautiful zen scene where the player explores different areas.

I wanted to explore how hard procedural generation was compared to the hand-crafted levels and how much control I would have. Through this exploration I was able to have a much better understanding of the design pipeline and what methods work well for different goals.

Working on this project there was a strong focus on learning fundamental computer graphics through implementing an OpenGL renderer. This forced me to understand the rendering pipeline at a much lower level and appreciate all of the technology that is abstracted in commercial engines.

This was a project that I was proud of the artistic direction. There was a sense that this was my project and that I was designing this from a artistic perspective. This gave me a opportunity to use my printmaking artistic skills to design for the screen.

## Artistic Direction

Based on [Sumi-e Japanese ink paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_wash_painting), the game is meant to depict beauty of nature through simplicity. Specifically, I want to capture the beauty of a field where a single tree stands alone, serving as the subject that gives meaning and purpose to the field.

## TODOs

- Game Engine
- Procedural World Generation  
- Grass Shader
- Shadows
- Camera

## Game Engine

The game engine was built completely from scratch using OpenGL. Learning the fundamentals of graphics through building something that eventually resembled a usable rendering API gave me a much deeper understanding of computer graphics. All basic rendering techniques were implemented from scratch, including the rasterization pipeline, vertex and fragment shaders, texture loading, model loading, camera movement, input handling, and basic lighting.

Through exploring this lower level implementation, I learned to appreciate the immense effort that goes into graphics APIs and commercial game engines.

## Procedural World Generation

I had experimented with two different methods of world generation. First I had tried completely procedural world generation through Perlin noise to terrain heights and biome placement. This gave me an infinite and interesting world, but I found that I as the designer lost significant control over the world that would be generated.

As an alternative, I had also tried a hybrid approach where there were hand-crafted "chunks" that would be procedurally placed based on some parameters. This gave me the ability to hand-craft interesting areas with detail, while still maintaining the infinite and explorable world.

Both of these methods had their own benefits and drawbacks. The procedural approach gives infinite content but removes designer control. The hybrid approach keeps designer control but requires much more content creation.

## Grass Shader

The grass was implemented through a geometry shader that would take in grass seeds and extrude quad grass blades. For each grass seed, information including wind direction, wind speed, grass height, and grass color was passed to the geometry shader. The geometry shader would then procedurally generate grass blades with the wind effects applied to create realistic grass movement.

Special care was taken to create grass that felt alive and natural. By adjusting the wind parameters and grass density, different grass fields could convey different moods and feelings, supporting the artistic direction of the project.

## Shadows

The game implemented shadow mapping to create realistic shadows from the sun. Shadow maps were generated by rendering the scene from the perspective of the light source, creating a depth map that could then be used to determine which areas were in shadow.

This lighting technique was crucial for creating the mood and atmosphere that the artistic direction required. The shadows helped ground objects in the world and created the depth needed to make the minimalist scenes feel believable.

## Camera

The camera system supported both first-person and third-person perspectives, allowing players to choose how they wanted to experience the world. The camera movement was designed to be smooth and contemplative, matching the zen-like artistic direction of the project.

Special attention was paid to camera framing to ensure that the lone tree and surrounding landscape could be appreciated from different angles, supporting the artistic vision of the project.
